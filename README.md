# Drug-Prescription-using-Fuzzy-Logic
A simple attempt to utilize drug seperation based on different parameters.

In this project we try to implement the following drug selction using Fuzzy logic.

Here's a table with three drugs used for osteoporosis management that are both age- and gender-specific:
| **Drug**      | **Age**             | **Sex**              | **Bone Density (Severity)** | **Additional Notes**                       |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Raloxifene    | Postmenopausal (50+) | Female               | Mild to moderate bone loss   | Reduces risk of vertebral fractures.       |
| Alendronate   | 40+ years            | Both, more in males  | Moderate to severe bone loss | Common for older men at risk of osteoporosis. |
| Denosumab     | 60+ years            | Both (varied doses)  | Severe bone loss             | High fracture risk; dosing differs by sex. |
